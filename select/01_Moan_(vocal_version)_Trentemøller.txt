Thinking about you
Constantly thinking about you
Thinking about you
I've been thinking too much about you
See the sunset with no sleep at all
Constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all
Thinking about you [2x]
I've been thinking too much about you
I've been staring at the floor
I've listened to all the tunes I love
But makes me feel quite blue
Thinking too much about you
See the sunset with no sleep at all
Constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all
I've been thinking too much about you
I've been staring at the floor
I've listened to all the tunes I love

But makes me feel quite blue
I've been thinking too much about you
Staring at the floor
I've listened to all the tunes that I love
But makes me feel quite blue
I've been thinking too much about you
See the sunset with no sleep at all
And I'm constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all
There are people standing by
There are people queuing up from behind
There are people standing by
Constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all
Constantly thinking about you
