I Gotta moan
I don't feel so good this morning
Ohhh
My baby's been gone a long time

Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to leave?
Ewww
Can't stand being alone

I All I do is cry
And moan

I remember when you used to love me in the morning
Ohh, you used to
Bring my coffee to my bed

I remember when you used to squeeze me
And rub my little achin' head
Squeeze me tight (?)

All I do
Is cry
And moan

I remember the good ole days
I never dreamed that there was a price to pay
Tried, tried, ohhh (?)

If I had just one more day
Maybe there's a chance that I could have made her stay
But now you're gone, and ohhhh

(Guitar solo)

I remember the good ole days
I never dreamed that there was a price to pay
Tried, tried, sooo (?)

If I had just one more day
Maybe there's a chance that I could have made her stay
But, oh, now you're gone, and ohhhh

All I do is weep and moan
Hey!

I don't feel so good this morning
Why did you have to go away?
Why did you have to leave?
Ewww, can't stand being alone

I All I do is cry
And moan

Hey, I
All I do is cry
And moan

Hey, I
All I do is cry
And moan

I remember when
Oh

I remember when
Hey
I don't feel so good this morning

Ewwwwwwww!
