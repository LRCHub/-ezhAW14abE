This is it
I had a job on the levee
I said I had a good looking woman, she lived in Hughes
I said I had a job on the levee
Yes I had a good looking woman, she lived in Hughes
You know that pretty little thing
She kept me with the government fleet blues

Oh, on every pay day
She'd be standing around the landing crying
Yes, you know on every pay day
She'd be standing around the landing crying
She be saying why don't that big boat hurry and
Bring home that man of mine?

You know there down the river
She could hear the big boat when she blow
I said when on the river
And she could hear the big boat when she blow
You know but when that little girl got the check
She told me she couldn't use me no more

Well I said little girl you didn't love me
Why didn't you tell poor me so?
Little girl if you didn't love me
I said how come you didn't tell me so?
I don't know that you love someone else
Honey, then you could go

But after little girl, sitting down in the back door crying
Aye yeah, I left her sitting in the back door crying
I said that done run the little thing crazy
I believe she gon' lose her mind

But I say honey, when you get lonesome
I want you to sit right down and write to me
Yeah, when you get lonesome
Honey sit down and write to me

You know I can read your little writing
Don't care where in this world I'll be
Oh when in my room and I sit down and I cry
When in my room I sit down and I cry

You know I didn't have no cool but I just wasn't satisfied
Oh what a shame, you know I am not ashamed
Yeah, aye, not a tiny shame
You know I am so sorry today that I ever known a little name

Oh, so hard to love someone that don't love you
You know it's so hard to love someone that don't love you
Don't look like a
Don't care what in this world you do
