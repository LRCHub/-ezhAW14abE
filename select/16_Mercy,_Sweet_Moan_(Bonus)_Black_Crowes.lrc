[00:09.61] Yes, when I'm gone, Lord, have mercy on me
[00:30.61] 
[00:21.71] Well I dream of a lady
[00:26.74] Like an angel comes to me
[00:31.66] And she cools me with water
[00:37.02] 'Cause I'm scared of the heat
[00:51.52] 
[00:43.72] But when I'm gone, Lord, have mercy on me
[00:44.83] When I'm gone, Lord, have mercy on me
