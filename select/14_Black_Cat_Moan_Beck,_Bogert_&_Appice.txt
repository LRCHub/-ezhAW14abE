Looky here

Sunshine coming over the hills
Through my window pane
Sunshine coming over the hills
Might as well be pain
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan

Laying by the side of the road
With the disels flying by
Looks like my head is gonna roll
Don't know the reasons why
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan cause I wanna go home
Got the black cat moan

Going back to Memphis
To find my sugar rey
Going back to Memphis
Cause that's where I want to be
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan
Got the black cat moan I wanna go home
Got the black cat moan
